Welcome to my new website. This is where I will post things related to books I read, as well as interesting things involving programming.

This site is built with [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/), using the [Origin theme](https://themes.gohugo.io/origin-hugo-theme/) by Andrey Parfenov. My old website was hosted with [Write.as](https://write.as/) - a very nice service, but it is better suited to simple blogs than the fully-featured tag system included with Hugo.

There are still a few things I would like to customize about the theme when I get the time. It's impressive how easy-to-use Hugo is. I set up this site in a couple hours with no previous experience.
