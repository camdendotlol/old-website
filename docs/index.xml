      <description>Welcome to my new website. This is where I will post things related to books I read, as well as interesting things involving programming.
This site is built with Hugo, using the Origin theme by Andrey Parfenov. My old website was hosted with Write.as - a very nice service, but it is better suited to simple blogs than the fully-featured tag system included with Hugo.
There are still a few things I would like to customize about the theme when I get the time.</description>
